          <p>
            As a side project, I wanted to combine the excitement of listening
            to your favorite song with calming activity of coloring. I
            transformed cover albums of popular songs into black and white
            printables, available for anyone to begin their interpretation.
          </p>
          <hr class="divider" />
          <h2 class="section-header">PROCESS</h2>
          <p>
            First, I sent out a survey to my friends asking what their
            most-listened to genre of music was over the last year, which was
            electronic. Afterward, I researched top-played songs and recent
            releases on Youtube. I compiled a playlist of over 100 songs on
            Spotify, then narrowed down the list to remove any repeated artists
            and styles of music. I chose to start working on four songs. I found
            images of the album art for each song, off of which I’d base my
            work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first image I wanted to transform was a beautiful, multi tiered
            flower. I wanted to utilize Photoshop to remove all colors and
            darken the outline for me. While this was a good idea in theory, it
            left me a greyscaled image that would take away from a fun coloring
            user experience.

            I turned to Figma to use an Image Tracer plugin, similar to the
            Image Tracer tool on Illustrator. I used this function for both the
            original and the greyscaled to compare end products, but the because
            of the heavy gradient usage, the traced image of the original had so
            many vector lines, it was almost completely black.
          </p>

                data-title="Greyscale image, traced. Some gaps"

            <div class="greyscale-text">
              <p>
                Instead, I worked with the traced greyscaled image, which was
                closer to my final vision. There were some areas that were
                open-ended because the Image Tracer tool could not pick up the
                edges.

              <p>To finish, I used the pen tool to fill in the gaps.</p>
              <p>
                Because the rest of my images weren’t as detailed or dense as
                this flower, I decided to mainly use the pen tool for the
                remainder of the project.

          <p>
            I presented the pages with the context that these images would
            remind them of some of their favorite songs. I did not show the
            original album art images.
          </p>
          <p>
            The coloring pages were well received. Many users could connect the
            outlines to the original image. People were reminded of the fun
            times they had at concerts that played these songs. I deemed this
            project a success!
