            Donut Hotspotting in Long Beach (with Yelp’s Help)

          <h2 class="section-header">CHALLENGE</h2>
          <p>
            Pink Box Stories aims to share stories focusing on entrepreneurship
            through the lens of donut shops. One of my projects was to create a
            single map and database of independent donut shops in Long Beach, a
            prime location for donut shops.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-header">PROCESS</h2>
          <p>
            As a starting point, I enlisted the help of Yelp’s API. (An API
            stands for “application program interface”; with limits, it allows
            us to access Yelp’s data and tweak it for our specific purpose.) I
            wrote a Python script that utilized Yelp’s API to identify and
            locate all the donut shops in the city of Long Beach. The query
            returned 200 results under “Best Match,” the default category from
            the API. According to the Yelp API guidelines, best match “considers
            multiple input parameters to return the most relevant results.”
          </p>
          <p>
            My script parsed through the review counts, ratings, and pricing
            information for each business that matched the alias, or our
            category of choice, “Donut”. Because I initially wanted to focus on
            Long Beach donut shops, the code filtered the results to show only
            businesses whose coordinates were within the City of Long Beach and
            had an alias, “donut.” The code returned 43 entries. I noted a small
            shortcoming in the information Yelp returned — the API may lag on
            updated information as businesses change hands, fall under, or
            recently start.
          </p>
          <hr class="divider" />
          <h2 class="section-header">SOLUTION</h2>
          <p>
            Armed with new data, I could weave together information with entries
            such as pricing, ratings and even reviews. The data revealed
            patterns, some that were expected, and some that brought a unique
            perspective to the donut scene in Southern California.

          <h2 class="section-header">RESULT</h2>
          <p>
            Out of the 43 donut shops in the area that we pulled from the Yelp
            API, 37 were independent and six were chain stores. The data show
            that independent donut shops in Long Beach are much better received
            by Yelp users than franchise locations of chain stores like Krispy
            Kreme and Winchell’s. Average ratings for the chain restaurants was
            a 2.6, compared to 4.2 for non-chain restaurants. In fact, only
            three of the independent shops scored lower (3.0) than the
            highest-scoring chain restaurant (3.5). Although the average rating
            count for the chain restaurants were higher (72.4 vs 51.3), the the
            top two independent donut shops had more reviews than all of the
            chain stores combined (707 vs 362).

          <h2 class="section-header">CONCLUSION</h2>
          <p>
            The significance of the donut shop, which gave livelihoods to
            thousands of Cambodian refugees, can be seen in the pervasive
            numbers of donut shops in Long Beach, an area where many Cambodian
            families made their homes. Yelp’s API helped us with a
            proof-of-concept and is the starting point for Pink Box Stories to
            get a data-driven picture of Cambodian donuts shops in California.
