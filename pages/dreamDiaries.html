          <h1 class="page-title">Dream Diaries: A Dream Podcast</h1>
          <h2 class="section-header">PURPOSE</h2>
          <p>
            I am fascinated by sleep and dreaming, and I had always wanted to
            keep a journal of all my dreams to interpret, but I could never
            devote 15 minutes in the morning to immediately jot down my dreams.
            Plus, my handwriting is so sloppy before I complete my morning
            routine.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day, my friend suggested I record myself. An excellent idea!
          </p>
          <p>
            After playing back my 1st voice recorded dream entry, I thought it
            would be fun to share it with the rest of the world through a
            podcast. I designed the podcast, gave it a name, determined the
            demographic, and now I host a podcast!
          </p>
          <p>
            You can listen to the show
            <a

          <p>ARTWORK</p>
          <p>
            I wanted to showcase a girl sleeping a night while keeping the idea
            of high contrast. At first, the girl’s hair was dark purple with the
            dark blue background, but I recently updated the artwork to reature
            a girl with pink hair to help her stand out.

              <a
                href="../images/Artwork Pink.png"
                data-lightbox="dream-cover-art"

          <p>NAME CONCEPTION</p>
          <p>
            I brainstormed a list of names that popped into my head. I landed at
            Dream Diaries because the alliteration hit the sweet spot. I looked
            online for any media names that were similar to mine. To my dismay,
            there was already a podcast called “Dream Diaries”, so I added “A
            Dreamcast” to the end of my title to help differentiate. I also
            believe that my artwork adds to its uniqueness.

          <p>EDITING AUDIO</p>
          <p>
            I edited my first episode in Audacity because I primarily focused on
            cutting out silent portions of my recording. I realized shortly
            after that I owned Adobe Premiere Pro, a more powerful software
            system. Although you would normally use it to edit video, it has
            awesome integrations for editing audio (audio is in videos, after
            all :D). I researched best ways to edit audio. I’m still in the
            process of figuring it all out, but I’m having fun all the while.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>UPLOADING TO A PODCAST</p>
          <p>
            Uploading is not as simple as one may think! I initially thought it
            would be similar to uploading onto a website like Youtube, but there
            is an extra step beforehand. You must upload the audio to a podcast
            hosting website first, then list it in directories such as Apple
            Podcasts or Spotify. The process was intuitive, and before I knew
            it, I had a few episodes going on Apple Podcasts.
          </p>
          <hr class="divider" />
          <h2 class="section-header">RESULT</h2>
          <p>
            So far, I’ve been sharing my page to family and friends who express
            interest in the show. It is an interesting concept, as the content
            creation is contingent upon my remembering my dreams, which is not
            guaranteed. Despite that, I have learned so much about audio editing
            and podcast hosting that I would do it again!
