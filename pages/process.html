          <h2 class="section-header">CHALLENGE</h2>
          <p>
            At Lifestreet, I strive to optimize processes to make daily tasks
            easier to complete, thus freeing up more time for more impactful
            work. One of the last projects I lead was to optimize the handoff
            process between Product Managers and Designers. Before, the process
            was repetitive, tedious, and uncollaborative. Product Managers would
            take over 1 day to ideate the entire flow. I wanted to assist
            collaboration across departments and increase efficiency.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-header">RESEARCH</h2>
          <p>
            First, I conducted a
            <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EY6xecNKHzw5XhZQUBzOnmTmu5foOx7c1wqkDJaSMU8/edit#bookmark=id.hhv4jjfvhzd4"
              target="_blank"
              >survey</a
            >
            within the team of Product Managers to pinpoint the main issue for
            developing a product.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our design team had been using Sketch to translate the Product
            Manager’s flow from a Jira ticket into a storyboard, which then got
            exported into a PDF for Developers to then code the product. In
            addition, Designers provided a Zeplin file which specified
            positioning of elements within the storyboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had heard of Figma from friends at other companies, and that Figma
            was starting to feel like the new industry standard for User
            Interactive design. I looked into the
            <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EY6xecNKHzw5XhZQUBzOnmTmu5foOx7c1wqkDJaSMU8/edit#heading=h.kpm5lw7zl322"
              target="_blank"
              >benefits</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            COLLABORATION: No need to walk over to someone’s desk (we’re in
            quarantine so this is impossible anyway) - simply send the file and
            look at it in at the comfort of your own seat. Sketch only allowed
            the owner of the file to make edits. However, in Figma both the
            Product Manager and Designer could edit and make comments directly
            on the file.
          </p>
          <p>
            VERSION CONTROL: Free version includes 30d history, where you can
            see who edited what, when.
          </p>
          <p>PRICING: free - $45/month</p>
          <p>
            I wanted everyone on an individual account to start in case there
            were advantages with other programs that would’ve prevented us from
            fully swapping over to Figma.
          </p>
          <p>
            EASE OF INTEGRATION: It is incredibly simple to port Sketch files to
            Figma.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was sold! I ran the idea by the Design team and we decided to try
            working on our next product solely in Figma.
          </p>
          <hr class="divider" />
          <h2 class="section-header">DEVELOPMENT</h2>
          <p>
            Armed with this information, I drafted a
            <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EY6xecNKHzw5XhZQUBzOnmTmu5foOx7c1wqkDJaSMU8/edit#heading=h.8iw2dv41x9lb"
              target="_blank"
              >new process</a
            >
            for Product Manager and Designer in the creation of a product. The
            main goal was to remove the feeling of the PM telling the Designer
            what to do, but to have both the Product Manager and Designer feel
            creative in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like anything new, there were a couple hiccups during the
            <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EY6xecNKHzw5XhZQUBzOnmTmu5foOx7c1wqkDJaSMU8/edit#bookmark=id.yjceu6bm7jbp"
              target="_blank"
              >Figma migration</a
            >. Some main complaints lamented on the difficulty of implementing
            specials fonts and complications for exporting screens into a single
            PDF file. For these, we needed to research more plugins and learn
            more about how Figma functions.
          </p>
          <hr class="divider" />
          <h2 class="section-header">SOLUTION</h2>
          <p>
            After the completion of our first product entirely on Figma, I asked
            for feedback. I received overwhemingly positive comments from
            Product Managers.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It was so nice to be able to talk over the flow with someone else.
            I loved being able to see what was being put on the storyboard in
            real time. It was easy for me to make comments too.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe we accomplished our goal of being transparent and
            increasing collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving forward, Designers will continue to research more techniques.
            I will be learning alongside them. I’m excited to keep learning in
            Figma!
